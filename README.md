- structure of project
- use d-flex to divide the page into small pieces (left-side-bar, core, stories-header ........)
 - division of component, services, models(i could use resolver to wait for data to arrive before showing the page but i thought there was no need)
- use local storage to save the number of likes of each post under a variable (id of post + 'nbrLikes').
- Trigger search to filter posts
- use skeleton loader on componenent i couldn't finish
